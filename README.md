# MAJOR-PROJECT-175M6

Gender identification is one of the major problems in the area of signal 
processing. The system deals with finding the gender of a person using vocal features. 
One of the most challenging problems faced is feature selection from wide range of 
features, which is discriminating factor in classifying the gender of a person.The 
objective of this project is to design a system that determines the speaker gender using 
the pitch of the speaker's voice. Identifying the gender from the properties of voice data 
set i.e., pitch, median, frequency etc. can be possible by using machine learning. In this 
project, we are trying to classify gender into male or female based on the dataset 
containing various attributes related to voice like pitch, frequency etc.The data set 
have features with explanation data points recorded samples of male and female voices. 
The data set can be trained with different machine learning algorithms. The proposed 
system can detect the gender of the speaker with real time test data a new solution to 
detect the gender of the speaker using Fast Fourier Transform with Logistic Regressionk
